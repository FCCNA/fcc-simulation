# fcc-simulation

This repository is related to the simulation of the crystal. I started with the example B4c and I modified it to fit the necessities of FCC and BelleII.

## How to run it?

You should create your build directory and run 

```cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/path/to/geant4_installation /path/to/this_repository/Simulazione_Gaudino/B4c/```

after this you can run 

```make```

and finally 

```./exampleB4c```

**DO NOT ADD THE BUILD DIRECTORY IN THE REPOSITORY**
